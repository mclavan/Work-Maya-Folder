Lesson - Joint Renamer
rigging_tools.py

Description:
	Practical use of loops.
	Renaming joint Based upon a naming convention.

How to Run:

import rigging_tools
reload(rigging_tools)


'''

# Will apply the system

def hierarchy():
	'''
	Create a hierarchy based upon a given system.

	Select root joint chain and execute function.

	'''
	Input
	What are we working on?
	The root joint.

	Padding Root Joint
