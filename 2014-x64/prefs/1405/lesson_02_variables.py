How to Run:

'''

print 'Lesson 1 - Variables'


'''
Variables are about storing information.
How do we create a variables
'''

# variable_name = value or text

rba_course_director = 'Michael Clavan'

'''
The equals here is not checking for equivlence.  It is assigning the value on the right to the variable on the left.
'''
cri_course_director = 'Ken Norman'


'''
These variables can be printed out.
'''

print rba_course_director, cri_course_director

'''
Variables can be reused.  The case below the variable lab_instructor is reused.  
Just like a glass of water.  The information inside the variable is over written.
'''

lab_instructor = 'Seth Freeman'
print lab_instructor
lab_instructor = 'Jennifer Conley'
print lab_instructor
lab_instructor = 'David Palley'
print lab_instructor

'''
Now move on to the variables exercise.
