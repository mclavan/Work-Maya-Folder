Name

Current Shelf Tools: ??
* Includes double click and drop down menu buttons.


# It is not required to have ether double click buttons 
# 	or drop down menus.  Just make sure you document them 
# 	below for easier grading.

Double Click Buttons: ??

Drop Down Menus: ??

Each tool you will need document:
	1) MEL Commmand
	2) What type of command is it and how did you find it?
	3) Convert MEL to Python.
	4) Important Flags

General Tools Research
'''

# Freeze Transforms

# Delete History

# Center Pivot

# Single Chain and Rotate Plan IKs

# Cluster

# Grouping (Does not need to be included on Shelf!)

# Parenting (Does not need to be included on Shelf!)

# Duplicating (Does not need to be included on Shelf!)

'''
Control Icons
- Circle, Square, Cube, and Arrow are the minimum requirements.
- Think about which direction the control should be pointed. 
	- Compare local oriented direction compared to world. 
- Nurbs square and cubes are NOT valid control icons.

# Circle

# Square

# Cube

# Arrow


'''
Constraints
- Remember to test offset on and off with these commands.
'''
# Parent Constraint

# Orient Constraint

# Point Constraint

# Pole Vector Constraint
# How does this constraint differ from the previous three.

'''
Attributes (Convered in Podcast)
'''
# Create float attribute

# Create Separator Attribute

# Template Attributes 
# Create a group of attributes at one time.  
# The finger attributes are an example.

'''
Proxy (Extra)
Modeling commands can be difficult to use.  In creating a proxy toolset, 
	we don't need to use them as a part of a bigger process.  
	I typically use the Run Time Commands in this case.

Research:
Detach Component
Separate
Extract
Combind
Nuke - (3 in one button) Delete History, Freeze Transforms, and Center Pivot
